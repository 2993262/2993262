Strong Force 
Strong force, also known as strong interaction. this force is the strong among them all fundamental forces. It is in short ranges, as it's plays the big role in binding together the fundamental particles called Quarks that form protons and neutrons, which in turn make up atomic nuclei. Gluons madiate this force, which makes the interaction easier between squarks.

After the Big Bang, the universe was full of hot squarks and gluons. The universe started to expand and cooled below critical threshold, then hydronization happened whereby squarks combined to form protons and neutrons leading to a strong force binding these together to form atomic nuclei and that developed elements that are responsible for life, therefore without this strong force the atomic nuclei wouldn't be formed and all the atomic based elements.

Weak Force
Beta decay in radioactive elements is one type of particle decay caused by weak contact.  It is essential to nuclear fusion, which gives stars their power.  The interchange of W and Z bosons, which mediate interactions that alter the sorts of particles involved, is how the weak force operates.

 Weak interactions and the creation of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis were two examples of early universe processes that relied on the weak nuclear force.  The production of hydrogen, helium, and traces of lithium occurred in the first few minutes after the Big Bang.  The production of heavier elements required for the genesis of planets and life would not be possible without the weak force, which would maintain the balance of nuclear reactions in stars causing the initiation of black holes.


The electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, emerged in the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang. Initially, all fundamental forces were merged in an extremely hot and dense state. As the universe expanded and cooled, these forces separated in a series of symmetry-breaking events.
In a fraction of a second after the Big Bang happened the Quark Epoch occured due to the universe expanding and getting cooler, the quarks began to combine into protons and neutrons. This started the Quark Epoch.
As the universe continued to expand and the temperature continuously dropped the electromagnetic force started to appear and photons which are the carriers of the electromagnetic force, started to dominate the universe. This marked the beginning of the photon epoch.
During the period of Symmetry Breaking, the universe underwent a series of symmetry breaking event whereby the fundamental forces of nature, including the electromagnetic force, began to separate from each other. The electromagnetic force emerged as a distinct force, mediated by photons.
As the universe continued to expand and cooler, the electromagnetic force became a dominant force, shaping the universe as we know it today. The electromagnetic force played a crucial role in the formation of atoms, molecules and eventually, the stars and galaxies we see today.
The electromagnetic force appeared in the first seconds of the Big Bang Theory as the universe expanded and cooled. Through a series of symmetry breaking events, the electromagnetic force separated from the other fundamental forces, becoming a unique force that shaped the universe as we know it today.




In the universe's earliest moments following the Big Bang, gravity emerged as a fundamental force, playing a critical role in shaping the universe's structure and evolution. The Big Bang originated from an infinitely hot and dense singularity, leading to a rapid expansion during the Planck Era. During this brief moment, all four fundamental forces gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear were unified into a single force.

As the universe expanded and cooled, gravity underwent a process called spontaneous symmetry breaking, which allowed it to separate from the other forces. This marked the beginning of gravity's influence on the cosmos, as it started to guide the distribution of matter and energy. Within just a few seconds, the universe cooled enough for fundamental particles like quarks, electrons, and neutrinos to form. Quarks began to combine into protons and neutrons, which became the foundational building blocks of atomic nuclei.

Einstein's General Relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It is theorized that gravity was an intrinsic feature of spacetime itself from the moment of the universe's inception. As gravity began to exert its influence, it contributed to the formation of denser regions of matter, which would eventually lead to the creation of galaxies billions of years later.

In summary, gravity's emergence during the early moments of the universe was pivotal in shaping its evolution, marking the transition from a hot, dense singularity to a structured cosmos governed by the laws of physics.
